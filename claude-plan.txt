 Security Analysis: Chef Migrator Transfer Contracts                            
                                                                                
 Executive Summary                                                              
                                                                                
 The migrator transfer contracts are simple and achieve their goal. The main    
 security consideration is resetting the migrator to address(0) immediately     
 after migration to prevent re-migration attacks.                               
                                                                                
 ---                                                                            
 Context                                                                        
                                                                                
 - MasterChef (Mainnet): Behind timelock - migration will be visible on-chain   
 before execution                                                               
 - MasterChefV2 (Mainnet): Multisig only - coordinate carefully                 
 - MiniChef (Polygon): Multisig only - coordinate carefully                     
 - User funds: Announced in advance + claim process for recovery                
                                                                                
 ---                                                                            
 Critical: Double Migration Prevention                                          
                                                                                
 Problem: No flag prevents migrate() from being called multiple times on the    
 same pool.                                                                     
                                                                                
 // This attack sequence is possible:                                           
 migrate(pid)           // LP tokens → Multisig                                 
 setMigrator(newAddr)   // Attacker changes migrator                            
 migrate(pid)           // Would pass balance check (DummyToken reports same    
 balance)                                                                       
                                                                                
 Solution: Immediately after migrating all pools:                               
 chef.setMigrator(address(0));                                                  
                                                                                
 This is the single most important post-migration step.

 Pools are in "zombie state" - they exist but hold no real value. New deposits  
 are automatically blocked.                                                     
                                                                                
 ---                                                                            
 Recommended Migration Sequence                                                 
                                                                                
 For Each Chef Contract:                                                        
                                                                                
 1. Deploy MigratorTransfer(chefAddress, multisigAddress)                       
 2. [SNAPSHOT] Record all userInfo for claim process                            
 3. setMigrator(migratorAddress)                                                
 4. migrate(pid) for each pool                                                  
 5. Verify LP tokens arrived at multisig                                        
 6. **setMigrator(address(0))** ← CRITICAL                                      
 7. set(pid, 0, true) for each pool to stop reward emissions                    
                                                                                
 Important for Claim Process:                                                   
                                                                                
 Before migration, snapshot the state for user claims:                          
 // For each pool and user with deposits:                                       
 userInfo[pid][user].amount  // Their LP token balance                          
                                                                                
 This data is needed for the manual claim process since withdraw() will only    
 return DummyTokens.

 Should We Reset Anything Else?                                                 
                                                                                
 Yes - Zero allocation points:                                                  
                                                                                
 // After migration, for each pool:                                             
 chef.set(pid, 0, true);                                                        
 This stops SUSHI rewards from accruing to zombie pools.

 The migrator contracts as written are sufficient. The security considerations  
 are operational:                                                               
                                                                                
 1. Reset migrator immediately after migration                                  
 2. Snapshot user state before migration for claims                             
 3. Zero allocation points after migration                                      
                                                                                
 The contracts themselves are intentionally simple - complexity would add more  
 attack surface.
